Project Title: Energy Consumption Prediction in Buildings Using Machine Learning

Buildings are among the largest consumers of energy worldwide, accounting for a significant portion of electricity use in both residential and commercial sectors. A major challenge in energy management is the ability to anticipate consumption patterns in response to dynamic environmental conditions and human activity. Traditional methods of forecasting energy demand often fail to incorporate real-time and granular variables such as user activity and ambient temperature.

With the advent of smart buildings and IoT-enabled sensors, large volumes of time-stamped data can now be collected, making it feasible to leverage machine learning for real-time energy prediction. This project aims to utilize this data to build models that can learn from historical trends and adapt to varying conditions, ultimately contributing to smarter and more sustainable energy use.

Benefits and Impact:
1. Operational Efficiency: By predicting energy usage more accurately, building managers can optimize HVAC systems, lighting, and other electrical components, reducing unnecessary energy consumption.
2. Cost Savings: Improved prediction allows for better demand-side energy planning, potentially lowering peak demand charges and overall utility bills.
3. Sustainability: Efficient energy use contributes to a reduction in carbon footprint and supports broader environmental goals.
4. Scalability: The developed models can be adapted to different types of buildings and integrated with energy management systems in smart cities.

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models to predict building energy consumption based on key influencing factors such as time of day, user activity level, and ambient temperature. The primary goal is to create a predictive system that can accurately estimate hourly energy usage, enabling more efficient energy management and planning.

Three different modeling approaches will be explored:
Linear Regression – to provide a simple, interpretable baseline.
Decision Tree Regression – to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) – to model complex patterns in the data for potentially higher predictive accuracy.

The dataset will include historical energy usage logs, time-stamped activity metrics (such as occupancy or device usage), and environmental data (including temperature readings).
